            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>HOW hardly we ſad doleful Truths believe!</l>
            <l>And though prepar'd, unwllingly we grieve.</l>
            <l>But here's a Subject calls for Floods of Tears,</l>
            <l>For who of <hi>Baxter</hi>'s late Departure hears,</l>
            <l>But is prepar'd to Weep? Yet Tears are vain,</l>
            <l>Not us they profit, nor that happy Man</l>
            <l>Who from the Vale of Sorrows is remov'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo much Eſteem'd, Admir'd, Belov'd;</l>
            <l>Whoſe pious Words which from his Mouth did come,</l>
            <l>Diſtill'd with Sweetneſs like the Hony-Comb,</l>
            <l>Is ſilent—Yet that Word I muſt recal,</l>
            <l>Tho' Dead, <hi>his Words yet ſpeak unto us all.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who can attempt the Subject of his Praiſe?</l>
            <l>All we alas! can ſay, are faint Eſſays.</l>
            <l>But ſtill Repect to's pious Worth is due,</l>
            <l>We cannot flatter, but we muſt be true:</l>
            <l>Learn'd tho' he was with all that Human Skill,</l>
            <l>Which empty Heads with Wind too often fill,</l>
            <l>Yet humble without Pride—his Learning he,</l>
            <l>Still made the Handmaid to Divinity;</l>
            <l>Thoſe Parts which other Men ſo much abuſe,</l>
            <l>He ſtill improv'd to a Religious uſe,</l>
            <l>Witneſs his Works in which tho' Learning ſhine,</l>
            <l>Yet ſerv'd as Foils to ſet off Thoughts Divine.</l>
            <l>But who his Heavenly Piety can paint?</l>
            <l>He did not ſeem, but ſurely was a Saint:</l>
            <l>His private Notions, though ſome Men condemn,</l>
            <l>Not Envy could his Life and Actions blame;</l>
            <l>So much of Heaven in his Talk was known,</l>
            <l>Atheiſts from him have with Convictions gone;</l>
            <l>To prove the Truth ſome Men much time have ſpent,</l>
            <l>He was <hi>Religiou's Living Argument:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For whoſoe're his pious Actions knew,</l>
            <l>He muſt believe Religion to be true.</l>
            <l>If as a private Man his Graces were</l>
            <l>So bright; What was he as a Miniſter?</l>
            <l>That Holy Function he his Pleaſure made,</l>
            <l>Religion was his Buſineſs, not his Trade:</l>
            <l>With empty Shews his God he did not mock,</l>
            <l>He neither car'd to fleece nor ſtarve his Flock;</l>
            <l>Painful in Preaching, conſtant ſtill in Prayer,</l>
            <l>The good of Souls was his—his only care.</l>
            <l>His Doctrins he ſo well apply'd, that all</l>
            <l>Who came to him for help, did never fail:</l>
            <l>To Weak gave Strength, to Scrupulous gave eaſe,</l>
            <l>And Balm apply'd to wounded Conſciences;</l>
            <l>The kind Phyſician of the ſickly Soul,</l>
            <l>How many now in Grief his Loſs condole!</l>
            <l>Altho' we cannot reach his Graces height,</l>
            <l>Yet lawfully we all may imitate.</l>
            <l>The Sweets of Sin how quickly are they paſt!</l>
            <l>The Godly Life brings pleaſure at the laſt.</l>
            <l>This Truth full well the Reveread <hi>Baxter</hi> knew,</l>
            <l>Who when he dyed, had nothing elſe to do:</l>
            <l>His Peace with God was made, how few alas!</l>
            <l>Of bright Profeſſors are in ſuch a Caſe?</l>
            <l>If for Degrees of Grace are here attain'd,</l>
            <l>Degrees of Glory are in Heaven gain'd.</l>
            <l>Sure Pious <hi>Baxter</hi> may be thought to be,</l>
            <l>A Star in Glory of the firſt Degree;</l>
            <l>Who after a long Life of Pains and Age,</l>
            <l>Death took him from this Frail, this Mortal Stage;</l>
